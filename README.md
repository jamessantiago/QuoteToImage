QuoteToImage
------------

This is a project mainly to redo some of the work described in [this project](https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/) describing how to setup a quote clock with a kindle.  I wanted something to kick out images for my kindle's resolution, but to also be universal for a text to image type setup.  Turned out to be a huge pain, so I'm not going to spend much more time on this...

Some tips
---------

 - Commandline arguments are shown with -h.
 - You'll find that quotes are a huge pain in console apps, I gave up and just changed them all to single quotes
 - The kindle expects images in a grayscale colorspace, I gave up on this again and used [pngcrush](https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush/) to do the work
